    <h1> What constitutes a creative web project today?</h1>
    
    <p> Creativity is very subjective but I think a creative web project has to have something new or at least something that is outside the expected website structures. </p>
    
    <h1>How do you wish to employ the web or internet as a creative platform</h1>
    
    <p> I want to be able to use the internet to be able to tell stories in unique ways that viewers can interact with. </p>
    
    <h1> What are your goals in this course</h1>
    
    <p> Learning more about web design and coding in general. I used to know some html so I hope to remember all that I have forgotten. </p>
